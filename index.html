      <h1>my february 2021 :o</h1>
        <p>hi!! so basically i wanna try something new. i decided to make you a lil website to show stuff about my life!!!
            i also wanna touch up on my coding, and i can show diff photos on here too (which i can't do in a letter).
            hopefully these mini websites get better as time goes on hehe. and this is pretty fucking cool right??!?!?!?</p>

        <h2>snow!!</h2>
          <p>new york has had a LOT of snow this month. i love it because the past few years the snow was
            all slush-y and gross. but this year the snow was so soft and powdery!! how has the snow in texas been?
            i heard a lot of people lost power and other bad stuff :( hope u guys were able to keep warm and safe</p>

        <h2>v-day</h2>
          <p>what'd you do for valentines day?!?? isa better have given you something nice. sadly i do not have a man
            to gift stuff to but look what my mom got me n my sister! they're little bubble tea bombs. inside is some
            powder and the outside is made up of sugar, so it melts when u put it in hot milk. (they taste worse than
            they look sadly but still cute af) also they look like there's condensation on them but there's not trust lol</p>
